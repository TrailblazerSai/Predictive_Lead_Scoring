# Predictive Lead Scoring

## Overview

The Predictive Lead Scoring project leverages machine learning techniques to score and rank sales leads based on their likelihood to convert into customers. The project is designed to help businesses optimize their sales process by prioritizing high-potential leads, ultimately improving conversion rates and revenue.

This project demonstrates the application of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning to solve a real-world business problem in CRM systems.

## Business Problem

Sales teams often face the challenge of identifying which leads are most likely to convert. Without a structured and data-driven approach, valuable time and resources may be spent on low-priority leads. This project addresses this challenge by:
- Scoring leads based on historical data and their characteristics
- Enabling businesses to focus efforts on high-potential leads

## Key Features

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identifies patterns and trends in lead characteristics
- Visualizes lead attributes and their correlation with conversion likelihood

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling
- Ensures data is prepared for machine learning models

### 3. Machine Learning Pipeline
- Builds multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Compares model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Selects the best model for lead scoring

### 4. Lead Prioritization
- Outputs a scoring system that ranks leads by their likelihood to convert

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data analysis and model building
- **Pandas, NumPy**: For data preprocessing and manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and evaluation
- **XGBoost**: For advanced model performance
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis and model building

## Project Files

### 1. lead_scoring_ml_model.ipynb
- Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, preprocessing, and model building steps

### 2. Leads.csv
- Dataset containing lead data with features such as Lead Source, Lead Status, and conversion status

### 3. README.md
- Documentation for the project

## Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Predictive_Lead_Scoring.git
   cd Predictive_Lead_Scoring
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Set up a virtual environment and install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Open lead_scoring_ml_model.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook lead_scoring_ml_model.ipynb
   ```

4. **Load the Dataset:**
   - Ensure Leads.csv is placed in the project directory for the notebook to access

## Insights and Results

### 1. Feature Importance
- Key features influencing lead conversion include Lead Source, Lead Activity, and Time on Website

### 2. Model Performance
- The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 85% and an F1-score of 0.83, making it suitable for prioritizing leads effectively

### 3. Business Impact
- Prioritized high-potential leads, enabling sales teams to focus their efforts efficiently
- Improved conversion rates and reduced time spent on low-quality leads

## Future Enhancements

1. Integrate the model into a CRM system (e.g., Salesforce) for real-time lead scoring
2. Use advanced hyperparameter tuning to improve model accuracy
3. Expand the dataset with additional features like customer interactions or historical sales data
